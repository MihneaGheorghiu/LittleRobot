Used JCreator 3.1 as an IDE

Because of the fact that the generation process for the individuals is random, for most of the cases the problem won't find a solution(true the genetic algorithms)

For implementing the algorithm I followed the steps in lab activity 9.

Program will retain the best individual and will make a graphic representation of his movement
quality of the individual = nr_mutari+lungime_drum_iesire-> (number of moves + length of the way out), the shorter the value, the better.

I used 11 situations based on what the robot is surrounded at a given moment, walls or blank spaces

To edit the map, which is generated by putting sqaure .jpg images based on the maze.txt map, edit that file, it's easy to see the * represents a wall and . a blank space

What you see as 'Calitate' first thing in the output is the length of the optimal path.
